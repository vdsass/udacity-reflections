Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A1. When you want to share and/or collaborate with other people.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A2. Other developers may update the remote repository and you may not want to incorporate those changes into your local repository.

Q3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A3. A clone is a copy of a Github or a local repository to a/another repository on a local machine. A fork is a clone (copy) of a Github repository on the user's Github account. A branch is a series of commits separate from the master branch within a repository - local or remote.
